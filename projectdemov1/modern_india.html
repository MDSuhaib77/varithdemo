                    <p>The Indian independence movement was a prolonged struggle aimed at ending British colonial rule in India.

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Before the formal independence movement began, several regional leaders and warriors across India resisted British colonial expansion through armed struggle and local uprisings.</p>

                        <h4>Notable Early Resistance Leaders</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Maruthanayagam Pillai (1725–1764):</strong> Born in Keelapanaiyur, Tamil Nadu, he initially served in the British East India Company's army. Disillusioned with British policies, he rebelled against them, leading a significant uprising. His revolt was eventually suppressed, and he was executed in 1764.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pazhassi Raja (1753–1805):</strong> Known as the "Lion of Kerala," he was the de facto head of the Kottayam Kingdom in the Malabar region. He led the Cotiote War (1793–1805) against the British East India Company, employing guerrilla tactics in the dense forests of Wayanad.</li>
                            <li><strong>Veeran Alagumuthu Kone (1728–1759):</strong> A polygar from Tamil Nadu, he led armed resistance against the British East India Company between 1750 and 1759. Captured during a battle, he was executed in 1759, becoming a symbol of early resistance against colonial forces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tipu Sultan (1751–1799):</strong> Known as the "Tiger of Mysore," he was the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. He fiercely opposed British expansion in India, engaging in four Anglo-Mysore Wars. A pioneer in using rocket artillery, he died in 1799 during the Siege of Seringapatam, resisting British forces.</li>

                    <p>The Revolt of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence, was a significant uprising against the British East India Company's rule.
